# Background

The Background section aims to clarify, deepen, and broaden the understanding of Panel with discussions about topics at a high-level or from alternate angles. This may include reasoning about design decisions, historical development, and technical constraints.

Beyond the [Getting Started > Core Concepts](../getting_started/core_concepts.md) that new users must internalize in order to begin working, this Background section is intended to help practitioners form and strengthen a conceptual web that facilitates new and advanced usage directions.

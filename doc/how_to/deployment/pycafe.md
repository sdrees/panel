# PY.CAFE Guide

This guide demonstrates how to deploy a Panel app on [PY.CAFE](https://py.cafe/).

PY.CAFE is a platform for creating and sharing data apps online, powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/). It offers a free tier for users.

## 1. Log In

Visit [PY.CAFE](https://py.cafe/) and either sign in or sign up for an account if you want to save your projects to your personal gallery.

## 2. Choose the Panel Framework

Select the Panel framework from the available options or use the direct link [PY.CAFE/snippet/panel](https://py.cafe/snippet/panel/v1).

## 3. Update the `requirements.txt` File

Add `panel` and any other necessary dependencies to your `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
panel
```

You don't have to pin version of panel or other dependencies as PY.CAFE will create a lock file with pinned versions automatically.

## 4. Update the `app.py` File

Update your `app.py` file with the following code:

```python
import panel as pn

pn.extension()


def model(n=5):
    return "‚≠ê" * n

slider = pn.widgets.IntSlider(value=5, start=1, end=5)

interactive_model = pn.bind(model, n=slider)

layout = pn.Column(slider, interactive_model)

pn.template.FastListTemplate(
    site="Panel", title="Example", main=[layout],
).servable()
```

After updating the file, save it, and the app will reload instantly.

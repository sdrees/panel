# Linking parameters

In the [Param how-to guide](../param/index), we have seen how Parameterized classes can be used to automatically generate a graphical user interface for Python code without any additional effort. If you need full control over how your GUI is set up, you can instead manually define widgets linking directly to other objects using either Python or JavaScript (JS) callbacks. Python callbacks are simple for Python users to write and can directly access Python data structures, while JS callbacks can directly manipulate the displayed HTML document and allow setting up dynamic behavior even for exported HTML files (with no Python process running).

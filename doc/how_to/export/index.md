# Exporting and Saving Output

One of the main design goals for Panel was that it should make it possible to seamlessly transition back and forth between interactively prototyping a dashboard in the notebook or on the commandline to deploying it as a standalone server app. This section shows how to display panels interactively, embed static output, save a snapshot, and deploy as a separate web-server app. For more information about deploying Panel apps to various cloud providers see the [Server Deployment](Server_Deployment.ipynb) documentation.

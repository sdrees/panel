# Using Param with Panel

[Param](https://param.holoviz.org) is a library for handling all the user-modifiable parameters, arguments, and attributes that control your code. Panel is built on parameters, so to effectively learn to use Panel you should at least understand the basics about Param. Therefore we strongly recommend reading the first few sections of the [Param user guide](https://param.holoviz.org/user_guide/index.html).

Panel supports using parameters and dependencies between parameters as expressed by ``param`` in a simple way to encapsulate dashboards as declarative, self-contained classes.
